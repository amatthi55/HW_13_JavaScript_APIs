# Dynamic Web App for Exploring Belly Button Data Set

This repo contains all files needed to run a web app that visualizes data from a belly button bacteria data set. The app is a Flask application that uses SQLalchemy to query the dataset, which is in a sqllite database. Plotly.js is used for the visualizations on the webpage. This web app can be easily adapted to visualize new data sets.
